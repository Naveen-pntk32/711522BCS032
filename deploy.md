# QuickURL Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **React Router Version**: Downgraded from v7 to v6.20.1 for better compatibility
2. **Build Scripts**: Removed Unix-specific commands that don't work on Windows
3. **Vercel Configuration**: Updated to properly handle static assets and SPA routing
4. **Node.js Version**: Changed from Node 22.x to Node 18 for better Vercel compatibility

## Steps to Redeploy

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues: downgrade React Router, fix build scripts, update Vercel config"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your QuickURL project
   - Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
   - The build should now complete successfully

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check that the build completes without errors
   - Visit your deployed URL
   - The page should now load properly instead of showing a blank white screen

## What Was Fixed

- **React Router v7 compatibility issues**: v7 has breaking changes that can cause routing problems
- **Windows build script issues**: Removed Unix commands that don't work on Windows
- **Vercel asset serving**: Added proper routes for static assets
- **Node.js version compatibility**: Using Node 18 which is more stable with Vercel

## Local Testing

Before deploying, you can test locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The preview should work correctly and show your application.
